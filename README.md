# Project Story: </br>
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data </br>
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria </br>
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security </br>

# Project Objectives: </br>
- Create a javascript to generate a password
- Include prompts for the user to answer to customize their password
- Prompts must include password length, upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters
- Generated password must display in the text area on the page

# What Was Done: 
- Mulitple trial and errors were attempted in order to ensure script worked properly
- To start, researched several other password generators and based my script off of my research
- Encountered one script that used "let" in place of "var" and "qry" in place of "prompt," is this new or old JS?
- Originally intended to work with group to complete the project, but once I began researching, it all became much easier
- Total time it took to complete assignment was roughly 90-120 minutes
